    <p>At your age, your brain is constantly growing and changing, even right now as you're reading this. From puberty to your mid-20s, synapses are grown and then pruned to increase efficiency. This process begins in the back end of your brain and moves forward to the front.</p><br>
		<aside><p>Synapse: Connections in the brain that are used for communication.</p></aside><br>
		<p>Because you're in the middle of these changes, only parts of your brain are fully developed. One still undeveloped piece of your brain is the prefrontal cortex. As a result, your prefrontal cortex is less able to perform its functions, such as making judgments and controlling impulses. Meanwhile, areas of the brain that play roles in reward and pleasure, such as your nucleus accumbens, are more developed.</p>
