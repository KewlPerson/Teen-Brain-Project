  <h1>Some Advice For You</h1>
  <article>
    <p>Now that you know more about your brain and its effects on you, what can you do? There are a couple of things:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><p>If you're having trouble making sound decisions, look to adults. Adults' brains are fully developed and do not face the same issues as you do. Take cues from them by copying the strategies they use to make choices.</p></li>
      <li><p>When observation doesn't give you as much info as you'd like, ask adults directly about their decision-making process.</p></li>
      <li><p>Finally, if you're facing a difficult choice, don't be afraid to let yourself really consider all the options. Ask for advice, list pros and cons, look at it from every angle, and generally make sure that you've really thought things through. It can be difficult, given that your teenage brain is inclined to be impulsive, but it will definitely be worth the effort.</p></li>
    </ol>
    <p>So far, all of this advice helps you and only you. But your parents or guardians can also benefit from this information. If they are more informed about the teenage brain, they might become more understanding to your plight as an adolescent. So, showing this website to them may be helpful.</p>
